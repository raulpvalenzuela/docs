# docs

This is an mdbook that pretends to be filled with useful information I gather through my progress in Linux (Arch).

The content will be composed by cheatsheets, instalation details, usage tips and tricks, etc. Each chapter dedicated to a single package or utility.

This is the list of hapters added up to the moment:

1. Introduction (still pending)
2. Neovim
3. youtube-dl
4. zsh
